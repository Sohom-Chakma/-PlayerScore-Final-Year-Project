# -PlayerScore-Final-Year-Project
There is a growing focus on statistical analysis in sports to identify the attributes that make for a successful team capable of winning more games and titles. What was once the concern of professionals and large organizations has, over time, caught the interest of the general public. Nowadays, even fans are delving into complex statistics. This shift has led to the formation of organizations that specialize in openly available databases, such as FBREF.com and basketball-reference.com.

In this project, I aim to utilize these databases to perform exploratory data analysis, identifying the optimal team composition for winning titles. My focus will be on teams in Europe, as UEFA (the European Football Federation) is considered the highest level of the sport globally.
